## Create React Skeleton (inspired by MIT Web Lab)

Use this tool to make a basic skeleton for a react web-app. It allows you to customize your backend server to connect to postgres/mongoDB, have sockets integrated, and have authentication patterns for Google and Local.

Run `create-react-skeleton [folder-name]` to install the react app in the folder of your choosing! The commandline will prompt you to choose between database providers, authentication strategies, etc.
